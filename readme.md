Subtitler WebApp
----------------

There are powerful and customisable desktop applications, full of features to aid you in subtitling.

This is not one of those apps.

It does however work on mobile, and has a few features intended to make youtube captioning easier.

Current Version: 0.6
  
But in all seriousness, if you have access to a better app, please use that instead.  
Don't hamstring yourself trying to do something in this.  

  
#### How do I build / deploy it?

That's the neat thing. You don't.  
It's a static webapp. Just open the index page in your browser.


#### I want to help out. Is there a style guide?

Are you sure you're ok?  

If you insist:

* Use tabs for indentation  
* Vanilla JS where possible  


#### I want to translate it to another language

All the text is in the app.translations.js file
Feel free to make add a new translation map under the region code and submit a pull request.

Though why you want to expose more people to this is beyond me
